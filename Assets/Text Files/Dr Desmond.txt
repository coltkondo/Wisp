Dr. Desmond Dairy (I)

"My name is Dr. Desmond. Fragments of my soul and memory tell me I have sadly passed away. I am writing this diary out of my old habit as an avid researcher. So where am I exactly? Heaven? Hell? Have I been given a second chance at life? How exciting is this! This place does not entirely resemble the country I come from, but seems to resemble Earth. I shall talk to the locals tomorrow and figure out the current state of things."

"Nothing dies and nothing is born."

"Such are the rules of the Underworld, or so I have heard. The spirits here seem to have been around since eternity. They have quite the grasp for time but they do not have recollection of a birth; nor do they see themselves meeting an end. They only mimic human nature, but why? I cannot stop my research here. What is a researcher if not a seeker of the unknown? Even if I were to stop existing altogether, I must still find the truth of it all. After all, nothing dies and nothing is born in this place."

...

"Aspects of nature that should exist do not. The sun, the moon, and the stars. They are all fake. Something controls the space and time of this place; or perhaps—someone. The Underworld is an immense place that meets no geographic end, but has no sky. The more I walk, the more tiring it gets. I do not understand the extent of this Underworld. It feels full of freedom yet so claustrophobic at the same time. Even so, amidst the chaos, there is a strange familiarity—a semblance of order born from the echoes of the world I once knew. Is this really an afterlife? Or is it just an imitation of a place that has ceased to exist? I must keep studying, I must keep researching…"

"I do not need to eat or sleep in this place, but I still do regardless out of habit. Last night, I dreamt of you again. You are the only person I still remember even now. I remember most things about you; but I cannot remember your face anymore. How have you been? Are you eating well? Where are you now? I miss you a lot, Eliza."
