Dr. Desmond Diary (II)

"My time here is limited; I know that much. I can feel the hourglass ticking against my fate. Memories that were once vivid and vibrant are now slowly vanishing like foggy mist. I started writing these diary entries as a way to record my stance here, but now I write them in case my memory fades away to a place I am scared to one day reach. I do not feel quite dead just yet though. How can one be dead and alive at the same time? Am I a ghost? Or maybe have I been transported to another dimension? There are more questions than answers can ever reply at this moment. I must keep researching. I know I am close to the truth."

"It makes no sense. It seriously makes no sense. The more I keep digging and uncovering, the more disturbed I find myself to be. The Underworld is just as its name implies, a subterranean realm that might exist underneath the spirit realm of Earth. Allegorically, it is indeed a cave, one that tries too hard to resemble a world with freedom. It has been decades, but I have not aged; nobody does in this place. The Grim Reapers are growing impatient, for they are constantly trying to bring my soul to finally "rest." They are said to guide the souls of the lost, but I do not need guidance; I need answers!"
