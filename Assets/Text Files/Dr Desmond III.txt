Dr. Desmond Dairy (III)

"My name is Dr. Desmond. I knew so much but died not knowing a thing. I was naïve, but I was scared; I know it was all my fault, but I did not have a choice that day. That tragic day...

"It seems that my time here has finally reached its end. So much for running away from them all these years just to get caught like a cornered rat. They are coming. I know they are coming.

To Eliza, I am deeply sorry. I am sorry for the pain I have caused you, for the dreams I left unspoken, for the love I could not give back to you. If I manage to get away from this, perhaps we will see each other here—even if I need to wait another five hundred years. 

I love you, my daughter."
