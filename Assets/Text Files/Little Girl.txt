[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Hey, are you alright?
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]Y-yes! I mean, no! Please don't hurt me!
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Everything is okay now. 
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]I'm Wisp. I'm not here to harm you.
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]A Grim Reaper? But you don't look scary. 
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Looks can be deceiving sometimes.
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]What's your name? Are you lost?
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]I-I'm Elizabeth. I don't know where I am. I just remember waking up here in this forest, alone.
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]I also lost him...
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]?
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]I lost my favorite teddy bear... I can't find him anywhere... 
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He was a gift from someone special, I always carry him with me. But one morning poofâ€”he was gone.
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He looks about this big... And like... About this fluffy...
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp](Do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down?)
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]Will you help me look for it?
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Count on me! 
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]I'm sorry to hear that, I know we can find your toy. Let's get to the village first.
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He's not a toy! He's Mr. Snuggles! 

Wisp: (Deep, rumbling voice) There you are. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

Elizabeth: (Trembling) Y-yes! I mean, no! Please don't... (Eyes dart around nervously)

Wisp: It's alright now. Everything's settled. (Kneels down, shadow stretching over Elizabeth) I'm Wisp. I'm not here to cause any harm.

Elizabeth: (Eyes widen) A Grim Reaper? But you don't look... menacing.

Wisp: Appearances can be deceiving, child. (A faint chill emanates from him)

Elizabeth: (Swallows hard) I-It's Elizabeth. I don't know where I am.  One minute I was... somewhere else, and the next... here. All alone.

Elizabeth: (Voice drops to a whisper) And I lost him too...

Wisp: (Raises an eyebrow) Lost who?

Elizabeth: (Eyes well up) My favorite teddy bear. Mr. Snuggles. I can't find him anywhere. (Clenches fists)

Elizabeth: He was a gift from someone very special. I always carry him with me. But one morning... poof. Gone.

Elizabeth: (Gestures vaguely) He's about this big... and this fluffy... (Looks pleadingly at Wisp)

Wisp: (Stares at her a beat too long, a hint of amusement in his voice) That narrows it down considerably.

Elizabeth:  (Pouts) Please? Will you help me find him?

Wisp: (A slight smile tugs at the corner of his lips) Consider it done.

Wisp:  (Stands up) I'm sorry to hear about Mr. Snuggles, Elizabeth. But we can find him. Let's get you to the village first. Maybe someone there can help.

Elizabeth: (Eyes flicker with a strange glint)  He's not a toy! He's Mr. Snuggles!
