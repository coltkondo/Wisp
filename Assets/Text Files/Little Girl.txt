[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Hey, are you alright?
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]Y-yes! I mean, no! Please don't hurt me!
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Everything is okay now. 
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]I'm Wisp. I'm not here to harm you.
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]A Grim Reaper? But you don't look scary. 
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Looks can be deceiving sometimes.
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]What's your name? Are you lost?
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]I-It's Elizabeth.
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]I don't know where I am. One minute I was... somewhere else, and the next... here. All alone.
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]And I lost him too...
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]?
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Lost who?
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]My favorite teddy bear. Mr. Snuggles. I can't find him anywhere. 
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He was a gift from someone special, I always carry him with me. But one morning poof. Gone.
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He looks about this big... And like... About this fluffy...
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp](Do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down?)
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]That narrows it down considerably.
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]Please? Will you help me find him?
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Consider it done!
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]I'm sorry about your toy, Elizabeth. But I'm sure we can find him!
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Let's get you to the village first. Maybe someone there can help.
[NAME=Elizabeth][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He's not a toy! He's Mr. Snuggles!
