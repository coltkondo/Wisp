[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]Hey! Hey! Listen! Don't hurt me, I'm not an evil spirit!
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]?!
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]You are a Grim Reaper, aren't you? I need your help, please!
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]What's the matter? Are you lost?
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]I think so..? I lost something important to me, but I can't seem to find it anywhere in this forest… 
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]Will you help me look for it?
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]Count on me! 
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]What's your name? I'm Wisp."
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]!
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]Where are my manners?
[NAME=???][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]I’m Diana. I arrived here a couple of days ago, but all I’ve been doing is getting lost all the time! 
[NAME=Diana][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]This place is like a maze!
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]It sure is, I myself don't know the extents of it either. 
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]May I ask what is it that you lost?
[NAME=Diana][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]I lost my favorite plushie… I can’t find him anywhere… His name is… Mr. Smith?
[NAME=Diana][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He was a gift from someone special, I always carry him with me. But one morning poof—he was gone.
[NAME=Diana][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He looks about this big… And like—about this fluffy…
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp](Do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down?)
[NAME=Wisp][SPEAKERSPRITE=Wisp]I’m sorry to hear that, I know we can find your toy. Let’s get to the village first.
[NAME=Diana][SPEAKERSPRITE=Girl]He’s not a toy! He’s Mr. Smith!
