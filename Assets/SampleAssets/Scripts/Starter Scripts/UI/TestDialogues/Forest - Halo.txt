[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]Congratulations, Wisp. You've graduated as a Grim Reaper, a role few can aspire to!
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]I'll be your mentor from now on, and I will guide you as you find your footing in this new role.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]This is the Time Watch, a tool of great significance to us Reapers.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]It's not just a device to mark the passage of time but a key to manipulating it.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]With the Time Watch, you can perform a variety of amazing thingsâ€”you see.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]It's an incredibly useful tool for a Grim Reaper after all, but remember, the watch's power isn't infinite.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]Use it sparingly and wisely.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]The watch can heal your wounds. It rewinds time on your physical being, undoing recent harm.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]However, this requires soul points, which you can accumulate by defeating enemies.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]These points are the lifeblood of the watch, recharging its powers.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]Lastly, the watch can manipulate time in your surroundings, not just within you. 
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]Find a path blocked or a bridge collapsed?
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]With the Time Watch, you can reverse such changes, creating a way forward.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]But, as with its other powers, this too hinges on soul points.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]Each use is a decision, so wield it with wisdom.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]And here, take this guide - a quick reference for the Time Watch.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]It'll be handy if you're ever unsure about its functionalities. Keep it close; it might just be the edge you need.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]Now, for your first task as a Reaper. I will meet you at the village beyond the Hollows.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]Consider this a test of your competence and understanding of your new abilities.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]Make your way there, and we shall discuss your duties further.
[NAME=Halo][SPEAKERSPRITE=Knight]I know we've just met, but I want you to know that I'm proud of you!
