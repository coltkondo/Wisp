Utilize a unique time-stopping watch to engage in strategic gameplay, face challenging boss battles, and navigate a dynamic world. Delve into a world of adventure, puzzles, and fantasy storytelling, where every choice shapes your path. Unravel the mysteries of the afterlife, one soul at a time, in "Wisp."

## Story

In the realm where souls linger before passing on, the Court of Stars once ruled justly over the afterlife. But now, corruption has seeped into its hallowed halls, turning its members into tyrants who view souls merely as fuel for their own power.

As Wisp, you begin your saga at the Reaper's Academy, freshly graduated and imbued with a sense of justice and a mysterious time-turner watch granted by your mentor, Halo. This powerful artifact allows you to manipulate time, creating opportunities to change your surroundings or rewind to crucial moments.

But the path of a Grim Reaper is not solely one of battle and strife. It is also one of redemption and empathy. Each soul you encounter has a story, a lingering regret that chains it to this world. Through helping these spirits resolve their unfinished business, you not only bring them peace but also gather the strength needed to confront the greater evil at the heart of the underworld.
